		<h2>Caseyalee (Casey)</h2>

		<p>Caseyalee (Casey) has been a solid companion to me for almost 13 years this December. Here are some fun filled tips in pertains to all 'Yorkipoo's' in general.

		"The Yorkipoo is a designer dog and is the result of Yorkshire Terrier to Toy or Miniature Poodle breedings. There's been an increase in multigenerational breeding (Yorkipoo to Yorkipoo), and also in Yorkipoo to Poodle or Yorkipoo to Yorkshire Terrier breeding; but many litters are first generation, the result of breeding two purebred parents.

		A Yorkipoo is active and energetic, as are both Poodles and Yorkies. He requires daily exercise and does well with a good walk or romp in the yard.
	
		Barking is a favorite pastime. Occasionally a Yorkipoo can be trained to bark less, but expect to hear the noise whenever someone comes to the door. He has no clue that his bark doesn't terrify anyone.

		He is a non- to low-shedder and can make an excellent companion for people with allergies.

		Daily brushing is needed to keep his fine, silky coat free of tangles and mats.

		Loving and gentle, the Yorkipoo can make an excellent companion to older, more considerate children. Like most toy breeds, he's not recommended for homes with very young children.

		He's easy to train if you use positive reinforcement. He's got a stubborn streak, though, so expect some occasional resistance.

		The Yorkipoo can live very happily in an apartment.

		He generally does well with other dogs and pets.

		A companion dog, he may suffer from separation anxiety when left alone for long periods at a time.

		To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from an irresponsible breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they're free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies, and that they have sound temperaments.</p>

		<h2>Coalster (Coal)</h2>
		<p>The American Longhair cat is a full-bodied, handsome cat with a dog-like personality and a medium-length to long-length double coat.

		The American Longhair cat was the result of attempts by breeders to infuse certain Persian color varieties into American shorthair cats. The longer coat and some of these colors seemed genetically linked, and the result was a cat with a combination of traits from both it's Persian and American shorthair ancestors. 

		Different from the Domestic Longhair which has no clear lineage, the American Longhair comes from champion bloodlines, and some individuals are registered in multiple cat fancier associations, but the breed itself is not recognized by the larger organizations just yet.

		The main difference between American Longhair cats and Domestic Longhair cats is that American Longhair cats must have a pedigree that can be traced back to both the American Shorthair and the Persian.

		Most American Longhair cats possess a bit of the snub nose of a Persian cat, but this varies among individuals. The well-muscled, athletic body is standard, along with the dense, and profusely shedding double coat."</p>

		<h2>Majestii</h2>
		<p>Majestii is a "Pure Bred Rosetted Bengal"; who is also pregant and almost due. (week of November 2)Here is some fun filled information about 'Bengals'.

		"The Bengal cat is a domesticated cat breed created from hybrids of domestic cats, especially the spotted Egyptian Mau, with the Asian leopard cat (Prionailurus bengalensis). The breed name comes from the leopard cat's taxonomic name.

		Bengals have a wild appearance; their golden shimmer comes from their Leopard Cat ancestry, and their coats may show spots, rosettes, arrowhead markings, or marbling. They are an energetic breed which needs much exercise and play.

		Early history:
		The earliest mention of an Asian leopard cat × domestic cross was in 1889, when Harrison Weir wrote of them in Our Cats and All About Them.

		The next recorded mention of an Asian Leopard Cat × domestic cat cross was in a 1924 Belgian scientific journal, and in 1941 a Japanese cat publication printed an article about one that was kept as a pet.

		The early breeding efforts always stopped after just one or two generations. Jean Mill was the breeder who decided to make a domestic cat with a coat like a wild cat."</p>

		<h2>Gremii (Grems)</h2>
		<p>Gremii is a mix between a 'Rossetted Bengal and a Savannah wild cats'. Here are some interesting facts you should know about the 'Savannah Wild Cat'.

		"The Savannah cat is the largest of the cat breeds. A Savannah cat is a cross between a domestic cat and a serval, a medium-sized, large-eared wild African cat. The unusual cross became popular among breeders at the end of the 1990s, and in 2001 The International Cat Association (TICA) accepted it as a new registered breed. In May 2012, TICA accepted it as a championship breed.

		Judee Frank crossbred a male serval, belonging to Suzi Woods, with a Siamese (domestic cat) to produce the first Savannah cat (named Savannah) on April 7, 1986.[4] In 1996, Patrick Kelley and Joyce Sroufe wrote the original version of the Savannah breed standard and presented it to the board of The International Cat Association. In 2001, the board accepted the breed for registration. The Savannah cat can come in different colors and patterns, however, The International Cat Association (TICA) breed standards only accept spotted patterns with certain colors and color combinations."</p>
